## Work Experience
-------------------
Aug. 2021 - Aug. 2022
: **Software Engineer**; MS4M (Lima, Peru)
* Participated in the creation of a machine learning facial landmarks detection model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture to detect key facial features to be able to detect driver fatigue in South American mines.
* Collaborated in the overhaul of fatigue detection metrics such as percent eye-closure over a time period (PERCLOS), Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) achieving an improvement in the accuracy of the model from 27.91% to 87.10%.
* Constructed an optimization algorithm to identify the model with the best hyper parameters such as the appropriate number of
epochs and learning rate to obtain the optimal blink and yawn detection results.

Jan. 2019 - July 2019
: **Junior Software Developer**; CDC Gold Peru (La Libertad, Peru)
* Developed a k-means clustering algorithm in R to identify haul truck delays in the mining facilities.
* Designed a tracking algorithm to trace routes taken by water tank trucks saving the company over $3000 per month.
* Upgraded haul truck scheduling efficiency by automating the process using an R script reducing the time spent on the scheduling
process by 85%.
* Supervised a team to design and implement an innovative irrigation system saving the company over $5000 per month.
